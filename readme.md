# Athentication with node.js

**So today I learnt about athentication in Node.js , here is what I learnt**

## Manual Setup

```npm
npm init -y
```

### Install dependencies

```npm
npm install express bcrypt
```

## Automatic setup

Clone this repository then initialize npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OliverIngle/learning-auth.git
npm init
```

## Extentions

To interact with the API, I used a VScode extention named "REST client" which lets you send requests directly from VScode. you can download it like this:

Open command palet in VScode then type this command:

```
ext install rest-client
```

[REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)

## Utilization

You can now browse through the code or code allong, everything is commented and should hopefully be usefull.

## Dependencies

In this project I used `express` to build the API and `bcrypt` for cryptography related tasks.
